                    <br>This generation of games ulitilized a graphic style called 2D which used
                    two-dimensional bitmap graphics. This graphic style uses many tiny parts, called
                    pixels, which are often different colors, to create images on the screen.
                    this allowed developers to create large and complex game worlds more efficiently.
                    The assets of the game would be separated with the world comprised of tiles and
                    everything else made as sprites, both of which would be reused repeadtly.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Top-Down Games</h2>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/gta.jpg" title="gta" id="gta" />
                    
                    <br>Also known as overhead view, is a type of 2D game which has a camera
                    angle that shows the character and the area around from above. Many early games
                    adopted this visual style, especially war games and construction/management games.</p>
                    Some popular examples of this style include SimCity, Pokemon, Tycoon Franchise,
                    The Legend of Zelda, and Grand Theft Auto.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Side-Scrolling</h2>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/sonic.jpg" title="sonic" id="sonic" />
                    
                    <br> types of games were 2D games with the viewpoint taken from the side
                    and either the sprites moved from side to side or the background was made to look like
                    it was moving. These types of games used schrolling computer display technology and
                    parallax scrolling to suggest added depth. Many games used this perspective style and
                    other graphical technologies to give their individual games a different feeling and play style
                    than the other games in the market.
                    <br>Some popular examples of games that used this style include Sonic the Hedgehog, Double Dragon,
                    Battle Toads, R-Type, Super Mario Bros., and many others.

                    <br>Also known as pseudo-3D graphics, is a 2D graphic style that would "fake"
                    three-dimensionality. This was done by using multiple different techniques that would
                    use a fixed point of view but would also reveal different facets of an object. Some
                    techniques programmers would use to achieve this pseudo 3D style include oblique projection,
                    isometric/axonometric projection, billboading, parallax scrolling, scaling, skyboxes,
                    and skydomes.
                    Some famous games that used this graphic style include The Sims, Diablo, Half-Life 2,
                    Final Fantasy Tactics, Doom, Street Fighter II, and many others.
