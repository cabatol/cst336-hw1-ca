                        When people talk about the first game, The word "Pong" gets thrown around
                    Although Pong was an early arcade game that became commercially available in 1975,
                    it was not the first. In all actuality, the first ever interactive game was developed
                    in 1958 named Tennis for Two by an American physicist named William Higginbotham.
                    It was made using a Donner Model 30 analog computer connected to an oscilloscope display.
                    The graphics for the game was nothing more than green lights on a screen.
                    
                    <br><br>
                         Most games of this generation used what were called "Vector Graphics". This name
                    refers to the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, and curves instead of
                    resolution-dependent bitmap graphics to represent images in computer graphics.
                    One benefit of this graphical style was the ability for the graphics to be scaled down to
                     any size without the quality being compromised. 
                     
                     <br><br>
                     Some famous examples of video games with this graphical style include Armor Attack,
                     Asteroids, Lunar Lander, Tempest, Star Castle, Star Wars, Battle Zone, Space War, 
                     Tail Gunner 2, Tennis for Two, and Warrior.
