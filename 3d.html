                    <br>With the increase of processing power and memory availability of computers, 3D graphics
                    readily became accessible to the gaming industry. Where 2D graphics used a "flat" image with
                    only horizontal and vertical dimensions, 3D graphics added a third dimension, depth. Where 2D
                    graphics uses pixels placed side by side to create images, 3D graphics uses a 3D coordinate
                    system and vector graphics to create shapes and images. This gives 3D graphics a more true
                    to reality and lifelike appearance than its predecessors.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Fixed 3D</h2>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/ff7.jpg" title="ff7" id="img" alt="ff7"/>
                    
                    <br>Fixed-3D is a type of 3D graphic style which has a game world where the forground objects
                    like game characters are rendered in real time, but background images are static or fixed. this
                    style gave even systems with minimal hardware the ability to render 3D objects. However, this 
                    made it so that the players frame of reference stayed the same at all times. Because the backgrounds
                    of these types of games were pre-rendered 2D images, developers would only texture the visible side
                    leaving the other side un textured thereby speeding up rendering times.
                    
                    Some popular examples of this graphic style include The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Final
                    Fantasy, Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil, Parasite Eve, and many others.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>First Person</h2>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/destiny.jpg" title="destiny" id="img" alt="destiny"/>
                    
                    <br>This graphical style renders the world in the viewpoint of the players character. Thus,
                    the player cannot see the avatar's body thought some show the weapons or hands. This viewpoint
                    is also frequently used to represent the perspective of a driver of a vehicle in a rancing game.
                    This allowed programers to forgo implementing complicated manual or automated camera control schemes.
                    
                    Some popular examples of this graphic style include Mirror's Edge, Theif, The Elder Scrolls, Minecraft
                    Portal, Fallout, and every first person shooter you can think of.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Third Person</h2>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/forHonor.jpg" title="For Honor" id="img" alt="For Honor"/>
                    
                    <br>This graphical style renders the world from a view point some distance away from the player's
                    character, usually from behind and slightly above. This allows the player to see the actions of 
                    the avatar and is commonly seen in action and adventure games. However, this style poses a difficulty
                    for programmers in the case of camera controls. Objects blocking the avatar, jumping cameras, going 
                    through walls, and controlling the camera and avatar simultaneously are some examples that programmers
                    must work through with this graphical style.
                    
                    Some popular examples of this graphic style include Grand Theft Auto, World of Warcraft, God of War,
                    For Honor, The Witcher, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, and many others.
